This repo contains all the code you need to make your Discord bot into a BDO Boss Alerter. All the data comes from scraping <a href="http://urzasarchives.com/bdo/wbtbdo/wbtna/" target="_blank">Urzas Archives</a>. Without an official api for boss spawns, this app is bound to break in the future. If a proper api ever does come out, I will go back and clean the messy code.
